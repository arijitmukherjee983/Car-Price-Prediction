# Car Price Prediction System

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary files to build a car price prediction system. The system utilizes various data files, code scripts, and machine learning models to predict the price of a car based on its attributes.

## Files

- **data.csv**: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the car price prediction model. It includes features related to car specifications and historical price data.
- **model.py**: This Python script contains the implementation of the machine learning model for predicting car prices. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **notebook.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the data analysis, model training, and evaluation process. It is useful for understanding the methodology and for experimentation.
- **model.pkl**: This pickle file contains the trained machine learning model. It can be used to make predictions on new data without the need for retraining.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, and then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt is not provided, you may need to manually install the necessary packages such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.


## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**
      Ensure the data.csv file is placed in the root directory of the project.

2. **Training the Model**
      Run the model.py script to train the model:

      ```bash
        python model.py
This will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model to model.pkl.


3. **Using the Model**
To use the trained model for making predictions, you can load the model.pkl file and use it as shown in the Jupyter Notebook notebook.ipynb.
